- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Beautiful drag & drop reordering with visual feedback
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Modern vehicle selection with detailed descriptions
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Advanced route settings with expandable panels
- ✅ **NEW**: Lock/unlock locations to fix positions during optimization
- ✅ **NEW**: Inline address editing with autocomplete and keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape)
- ✅ **NEW**: File preview before import with location validation
- ✅ **NEW**: Example CSV and JSON files for testing
- ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Route calculation now requires all addresses to be geocoded first
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Clear visual indicators for ungeocoded addresses with quick "Resolve" action
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Status indicator showing geocoded vs. unresolved addresses count
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Button disabled with explanation when addresses need resolution

### Previous Critical Bug Fixes:
- ✅ **MAJOR FIX**: Route optimization algorithms now work correctly (shortest distance ≠ fastest time)
- ✅ **MAJOR FIX**: Map now shows real road routes instead of straight lines between points
- ✅ **IMPROVED**: Added advanced optimization for small route sets (≤6 locations use permutation analysis)
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Route visualization uses OSRM API geometry for accurate road display
- ✅ **ADDED**: Different colors for route segments (blue for normal, red for loop return)
- ✅ **ADDED**: Fallback visualization with dashed lines when road data unavailable
- ✅ **OPTIMIZED**: Algorithm performance for larger route sets (>8 locations)
