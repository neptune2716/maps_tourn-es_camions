# Base Configuration Instructions
This file serves as a template for the base configuration of the repository. It includes essential guidelines and settings that should be applied universally across all projects within this repository.

## General Guidelines
- Ensure that all code adheres to the project's coding standards.
- Maintain clear and concise documentation for all functions and modules.
- After each change modify the todo list in the TODO.md file to reflect the current state of the project.


## The project
- The project is a web application that allows users to find the shortest routes between multiple locations.
- it should be usable for both cars and trucks.
- the user should be able to either enter the locations manually or upload a file with the locations.
- The locations can be either just addresses or GPS coordinates.
- the user should be able to lock the order of the locations. (for example if the user wants to visit a specific location first or last)
- the application should calculate the shortest route based on the provided locations.
- The application should provide a visual representation of the route on a map.
- the user should be able to use a "loop" option, which allows the user to return to the starting point after visiting all locations.
- The application should be responsive and user-friendly.
